whom he wished arrd in the manner that suited him best. Iis nature
might thus become known and its contenis repeated by others. Tacitus,
as well as Dio, may have read or heard oi such a fourth document. cf.
Tea, Anu. Ι. 11. t ff. : proferri libellum recitarique iussit. Opes publicae
continebantur, quantum cisium sociorumque in amnis, quot classes, reyna,
prouinciae, tributa aut teetipalia, et necessitates ac laryitiones. Quae
cuneta sua manu perscripserat Auyustus addideratque consilium coercendi
intra temninosimperii, incertum metu anper inuidiam. The last state-
ment 11 the Tacitus passage ean hardly reier to the breuiarium and must
have reference to the fourth document mentioned by Dio. cf. note to
page 57, line 15. ·

2. indicem rerum a se gerarum: an account os bis mbieoements.
Maec (Esset sur Suetone, 137) points out that our author's use oi uellet
(line 3), rather than noluit, indicates that the emperor's wish of having
this record inscribed on bronze tablets was not reaiized. The greater
part oi an exact copy inscribed on marble in Greek and Latin characters
has been preserved at Ancyra (modern Angora), in Galatia, in Asia Minor.
This is the Monumentum Anaranum so often quoted in these notes.
There are also fragments ol a copy at Apollonia in Pisidia. The title ol
this inscription, thrice repeated, seems to prove conclusively that the origi-
nal copy was engraved on pilae, columns or pillars, which stood in iront oi
the Mausoleum at Rome: Rerum 9111111111 diri Auyusti . . . incisarum
in duabsu abeneis pitis, quae sunt Romae positae, exemplar 1111111111.
Dio (-Xiph. LVI. 33. 1) states that Augustus ⁴ gave orders that they should
be inscribed on bronze stelae placed near the Mausoleum '. The reproduc-

· tions in the provinces were, apparently, inscribed on temples oi Augustus

and Rome; see note to page 77, line 19. The Greek version was in the
κοινὴ διάλεκτος, the Greek language as commonly spoken in polite circles
at that time. The best text is that restored and revised by Theodor
Mommsen, Res Gestae Diri Aupusti, 1883. See Introd. I, pagos xlv ii.

4. breviarium totius imperil: a tabulated schedula os the state os
the entire empire. In Gaib. 12. 3, breuiarium rationum means ‘an ab·
straet oi accounts ’. The rationes imperii ab Aucusto proponi solitas oi
Galia. 16. 1 refers to the ‘balance shect' that was periodically published.
See note to page 62, line 1. cf. Tac.,1lnn. Ι. 11. aff„ quoted above in
note to line 1. See Introd. ΙΙ. ξ l. b.

page 69, line 31. vectigaliorum residuis: arrears of tanes. The
form aeetiyaiiorum occurs again in Galia. 16. 3, while the more common
torm is found in Tib. 49. 2.
