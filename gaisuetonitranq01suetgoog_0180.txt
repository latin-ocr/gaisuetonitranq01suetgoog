Chapter 1. Early Life

Paga 1. 1. Annum agens sextum decimum: ithae been generally
supposed that Julius Caesar was born July 12, 100 n.o., but Mommsen
argues from the dates when he held his magistracies that he must have
been born in 102 ao. There is no record of any privilege granted him to
hold office before the legal age. llis first consulship was in 59 aa, and

⁴ if he was then forty-three, he must have been born in 102. See The Year
os Caesar’s Birta, by Monroe 11. Deutsch, Trarrsactioae os tlte American
Philotoateai Assooiata‘oa, xlv, 17. patrem amisit: ifwe assume 100
na. as the date of his birth, then he lost his father in 85 aa. when Cinna
was consul the third time, with Carbo as his colleague. Pliny (N. Η.
v11. 181) makes a carious statement; Naiiia evidentioris causis obiere
dam calciaretur matutino duo Caesares, praetor et praetura perfunctas
dictatoris caesaraeae, bic Pisis exanimatae, iile Romae. The praetor
referred to was Luciue; the dictator’s father, the err-praetor, was Gaius
Julius caesar. sequentibusque consulibus: te. 83 ao. (or 85).
