plebi scito: Pompey when sole consul in 52 ao. had allowed some oi
the tribunes to carry· a lew permitting Caesar tc be a candidate while
still absent from Rome. Apparently obrogare was used transitiveiy in
theclassical period. abrogasset: had annulled; most editions read
obrepueeet. The law as passed did not contain the clause excepting
Caesar 110111 the general requirement that all candidates must be present
at the time 01 tbe canvass. But 11 had been intended to except Caesar3
therefore Pompey, aiter the law had been passed, inscribed on a bronze
tablet, and deposited in the cerarium, went and made the alteration,
inserting the clause in Caesar's favor. Marcellus held that he had
110 right to do so, and that the lau, without the exception, was stili in
:force His opinion was apparently correct.
