orator. He has a cataloguer's fondness for divisions and
elassifications. From the rhetorical point of view hc would
have avoided the numerous verbatim citatione which he incor-
porated into his text. He constantly seeks precision of detail;
the rhetorical historiens sought in their themes the
opportemity to display their eloquence. But Qf¹⁸¹ffl⁰⁸⁰f
the extreme plainness of his style is by no means ω “9¹⁰
the result of carelessness or indifference to form. His style
is marked bya high degree of technical correctness, and his
caloae, that is, the metrical cadences which conclude his
periodo, show that his attention to form was both conscious
, and constant. In thus writing “ metrical prose '', he was fol-
lowing the example of writers whose spirit was'as different
from his as their style - cicero and Pliny. But above all he

statement and in expression, in fact and in language. His
style is not ill described in his own words about that of

We have no record of any public or official position held by
Suetonius before his appointment by Hadrian as secretary ab
epistulis, about 119 an, nor after his dismissal
from that position. Whether he saw any military fffisffi
service is doubtful, though he was an officer⁷s son.
Pliny's letter (III. 8), from which we learn that he declined
the military tribunate offered to him, is the only informa
tion we have on this subject. It may have been that, after
this, he became a grammaticae, feeling himself unfit for the
army or the bar. It was in 105-6 an. that Pliny upbraided
him for the κ long delay in publishing his writings. The
work alluded to can hardly have been the XII Caesare, which
appeared some fifteen years later. It probably was the De
