A. Manuscripts

Munusonrrrs of Suetonius in immense numbers are tabe
found in the various libraries of Europe and Great Britain.
Many of them have been thoroughly collated and carofirlly
appraised, butthere is still no general consensus· of opinion
regarding the classification of individua] manuscripts and the
relationship which exists between certain of the more impor-
tant ones and those which, until more recent years, were con-
sidered of little or no authority in establishing the text of
Suetonius. This is particularly true of manuscripts of the
fifteenth century. Their real value and their relation to other
manuscripts are yet to be determined by means of even more
extensive collations than have been published. Among the
more valuable manuscripts, the following are now pretty gen-
erally recognized.l ,
