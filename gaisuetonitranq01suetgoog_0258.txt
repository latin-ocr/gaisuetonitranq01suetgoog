6. Μ. Antonius libertinum, eta: Marlc Autong tuito lim 011110
preatpraadfatber, sopiup ibat be aaa asreedman; in his lettere, as is
learned also 110111 Το0., Aua. IV. 34. 8: Antonii epistulae, Bruti cautiones
falsa quidem iu Augustum probra, set multa cum acerbitate babent. . . .
aed 1000 dirus lulius, ipse dicus Augustus et tulere ista et reliquere, baud
facile 1110011111 moderatione magia aa supientia. He attacked Augustus
in edicts, also ; cf. Cia, Pbil. III. 6. 15, At quam contumeliosus iu 01101101
quam barbarus! quam rudis! Primum iu Caesarem maledicta conpescit,
etc. See Aug. 7. 1, 10. 4, 16. 2, 28. 1, 69. 1-2, 70. 1, 101 similar 11011110
by Antony. libertinum: with reference to his politico-social position3

while libertus is the freedman in relation 10 his former master. Libertiuus '

sometimes meant ‘son of a libertua'; 01. Claud. 24. 1, ignarus tempori-
bus Appi et deinceps aliquamdiu libertinos dictos nosipsos qui mauu
emitterentur, aed ingenuos 00 bis procreatos.

7. restionem: a rope-malcer; only here in this sense. Plautus
(Most. 884) uses the word 01 ‘one who deserves 10 be flogged’. See
Introd. II. §L b. e pago 'l'hurino : from tlte district os Tburii,· used
iu the same sense 00 Thurinum aprum (1111016, below) and repioue
11101100 (page 48, line 32). Thurii, near the bay of Tarentum and 1101
101 from the site of the ancient Sybaris, 1100 one of the latest 01 the
Greek colonias in Magna Graecia; founded in 443 ac. by colonists sent
0111 from Athens, among them the 1110101101 Herodotus and the orator
Lysias A Roman colony with Latin rights was settled there in 193 ne.
under the new name of Copia. cf. Liv. XXXIV. 53. 1, XXXV. 9. 7.

8. argentarium: money-cbauger, banber; as a private banker 101
the exchange and loan 01 money, originally distinguished from the num-
mutamus, a state officer 01 1110 mint who assayed and distributed newly
coined money. Later the nummularii did aregular banking business,
receiving deposits 01 funds, opening current accounts and making
loans, in addition to their official functions. Memmius, another term
for ‘banker', was used with reference 10 his mensa, 01 ι00011101, as
τραπεζίτης 01 the Greek money-changer, still in evidence on the streets 01
modern Athens. By imperial times the three ternis had come 10 be used
indiscriminately: witness the fact that all three were applied 101110 ances-
tors of Augustus, 00 is seen from 0 comparison 01 0111 passage with Aup. 4. 2,
where nummularius and mensurius both occur. In Ner. 5. 2 argentarius
10 apparently used 10 mean ‘silversmith'. The general attitude towards
persons 01 this occupation was doubtless influenced by the wealth and
standing 01 those concerned. Nothing further is known 01 0 rope-welk 01
1100010111 at Thurii and 0 bank in the family 01 Thurii or Velitrae.
