³1. cognomen Thurino : the Roman’s praenomen was his personal or
‘given’ name, his nomen indicated his oens ; his eremmon was often, as
here, a nickname in its origin. strictly speaking, however, this is an
nonomen, sinoe the economen would naturally indicate the family. Au-
gustus was in his third year when, in 60 nc, his father was successful
against the renegades at Thurii. The name may, therefore, have been
given him because of family pride in the father's success, as was the case
with Germanicus. Ihne has shown (R. Geren. VII. 304. n 2) that
another name assigned him by Dio (XLV. 1. 1) should be read Karios,
not Καιπίας 61 the Mss, and the revised Dindori edition accepts this
reading. It is thus a translation of Marinus, since copta was the name
given to the Roman colony settled at Τ1111111; see note to page 47, line 7.
Karnion is found only in Zonaras (X. 13), who copies Dio. consult

ln memoriam : so on page 13, line 7, infiliae memoriam, and Gal. 15. 2,
in memorium putris. Cicero (Beni. XVI. 62) has ad memoriam landum
domesticarum. See Introd. II. §b le. (l). (a). For the inconcinnity
here see Introd. ll. ᾗ 10. o.

32. originis : with reference to ‘birth-place ', ‘home' of his ancestors.
h'ot only Antony and others spoke of Thurii as tbe home of his ancestors,
but Augustus is himself said to have expressed sarreriae that a previous
name 111 the family should be used as a reproach against him ; cf. Any. 2.
3. regiona Thurina: Suetonius omits the proposition in with regione
when accompanied by a defining geintive or an adjective indicative of a
place; cf. line 12, above, regione Palati, page 20, line 15, regione Morti
compi. See Introd. H. g 4. r. recens eo natet not lano after hia
son'a birth ,· in the third year of the young Octavius. Recens may here
bean adjective used adverbially, while in Tib. 1. 1, Romam recena con
ditem, itis an adverb proper.
