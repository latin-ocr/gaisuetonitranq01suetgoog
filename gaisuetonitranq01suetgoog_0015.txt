X INTRODUCTION

Our author’s friendship for Pliny is insufficient proof that

he was horn and brought ¹up in Transpadane
hiengrmp Gaul. Mace argues, but upon very slight evi-
m uny dence, that he was a Roman of Rome. All we
can say is that there is no real evidence to the contrary.

'l'he word contubernalis, more than once applied by Pliny to
Suetonius, implies a certain degree of intimacy and affection,
though it is clear that Pliny felt towards his humble friend
the superiority of a protector and patron. But contubernalis
rather implies some approach to equality in their ages than
so great a differenoe as fifteen· years.

As to Suetonius's occupatior, Pliny calls him scholasticus ;
Joannes Lydus,¹ in the sixth century, φιλόλογοςς Suidas,²

testes and pursuits, or in the sense of a professione] toacher?
If he was a teacher, we should be inclined to judge by the
style of his writings, the subjects, character and method of
his works, and his evident temperament and point of view,
that he was not a rhetor, but a'prommoticue in the strict sense
of the word. It is true that we learn from Pliny³ that he
was once engaged as an advocate. We know nothing of other
cases in which he may have been engaged, and therefore can
say nothing of the length or success of his career at the bar.
We have, it is true, the impression of a quiet,
modest, studious man, apparently somewhat super-
stitiouS, without much courage, decision or selfassertion and
not gifted with rhetorical ahility. Everywhere we observe
his interest in details, in minute correctness, everywhere a
⁴ sober and precise mode of expression, nowhere the tendency
to wax eloquent, to adorn his page with the flowers of rhetoric.
He writes much more like a grammarian than a professional

and otmacter
