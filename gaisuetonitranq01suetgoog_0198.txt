Pege 9. 1. Mithridate rege victo ι Pompey had come back toRome
1162 ac. and had disbanded his troops. 'l‘he Senate had continually de.-
lerred the confirmation of his arrangements in the illast, where his great
conquests had been made, and also 01 the provisions for his veterane.
Pompey naturally grew more and more irritated against the optimates. It
was bad policy on their part; they needed Pompey’s influence and
prestige.

3. ex consulatu: they had been rivale ever since they were young
officere under Sulla, and their mutual dislike had been intensifled by their

lictorsif necessary. The change made by Caesar was not in having the
oroerrsus go before him, but in having the lictors follow him instead oi
going without them when his colleague had the fasces.

11. nege . . . agras-la: this was the famous Lac Iulia Agraria, the
chief object of which was the distribution of rich public lands in Campania

missioners (otpiottvirt) were to be named 10 execute the law. Cicero was '
