rc. Clauses introduced by ut, often preceded by iio and simi-
lar vords, are used to express a restrictiori or proviso:

ib macrias. . . esse voluit at tumen pori iure essent, Any. 56.2;
⁴ id ui.. . esperooceretur, Aac. is.1; noa tumen at. . . sudaret,
Au. sa1; seo ui. . . restrictiores.

ii. Psnr1crrnns, Iurnvrrrvus, Gunuuns nun Gnuuuoivns

a. No writer, probably, uses a larger number of participles
iliu Suetonius, who employs them in a variety of construe
licusoften for the sake of greater brevity, but hardly with
the admirable perspicuity of Livy. Eight, ten or more par· ’
ticiples occur in a single period:

eight in a sentence oi five lines in Jui. 62; ten ina somewhat longer

sentence in Aac. 16.1‚ Siculam ballum. . . affectu fourteen in a single
long period in Auo. 27. 3 f.‚ Num et Pinariam . . . insidiis perisse.

(1) The future. active participle is often used to express
purpose or design, as in Greek, as well as time and otherra
lations :

maerori sibi, Jul. 21; quamprimum transfretaturi, Jul. 34.1;
sindicoiums siquid . . . constitutum esset, .Ιαὶ. 30.1; Tiberium . . .
dimissurus et Bcrwoentum usquc prosecuturus, Aac. oi. 3.

(2) The perfect participle is commonly usfil in the present
sense after Livy's time:

condo . . . coast. . . clato laevo. . .trcbcas, Jcl. 64; subsecutus, ²

Aug. 801.

(3) The present is sometimes used because of the lack of a
perfect active participle:

Ac subinde . . . udmorwos, Jcl. 65.

(4) The impersonal use of the participle in the ablative
absolute occure, often with the force of an adverb:

accurato, Aac. 7. 23 consulto, Jci. 56. 4 ; sortito, Aac. 30.1.
