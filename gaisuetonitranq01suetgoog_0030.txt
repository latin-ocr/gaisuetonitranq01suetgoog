ma OF SUETONIUS XXV

tores Historiae Augustae, Aurelius Victorand Eutropius, Servius,
the commentator of Vergil, and Macrobius either preserve for
us curicus bits of varied information drawn from Suetonius
or base upon his works the form and, in some cases, the sub
stance of their own. Ausonius versified the XII Caesare.

Lactantius and Ambrose were familiar with Suetonius, and .

St. Jerome took for the model and chief source of his De Viris
Illustribas Suetoniusâ€™s work of that name. In the early Middle '
Ages Paulinus of Milan, Orosius, Aelius Donatus, Cassiodorus,
Priscian, Isidore of Seville show knowledge of Suetonius and
indebtedness tobim. Yet by the beginning of the ninth
century the XII Caesare were in danger of being lost to the
world, when apparently only one mutilated manuscript was
known, the archetype of all that we now possess. This was
fortunately multiplied in the reign of Charlemagne bytho
copyists working at 'lours under the direction of Alcuin.
Soon after, Eginhard composed his life of that great monarch
in close imitation of Suetonius's Augustus. Even in the twelfth
century William of Malmesbury cites the Prata and John of
Salisbury makes use of excerpts from the Caesars.
