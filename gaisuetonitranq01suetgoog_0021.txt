from the extant inscription are noticeable‚ these have been
shown to be rather inconsiderable or else intentional on the
part of Suetonius. This is on the presumption that the
passages in question from the Monumentum Anerstaaum are

. not deviations from the original consulted by Suetonius. In

any event, it is unlikely that other manuscript editions of¹
Augustus's account of his own achievements were then in
existence. Itis quite probable, therefore, that Suetonius, while

’ secretary (ab patalis) to the emperor Hadrian, consulted the

original document in the imperial archivea as wellas the will
and letters of Augustus.

As to the letters of duliae, we know that many of them had
been published. These and others may have been preserved

in the imperial archives. Itis not unreasonable
tc suppose that Suetonius examined the originale.
ᾗ The precision of his description of the form of
Caesares letters to the Senate suggests this inference: quos
primum videar cd pupione et scrotum mmortales libelli conver-
tisse, cum antea consules et duces aea nisi transuerso chana
scriptas macereas

On the whole, however, Suetonius cannot have studied the
Palatine arohives long and exhaustively; his tenure of the
office ab epistulis came too late and lasted too shorta time. As
for documents aocessible to the public, those he had had time
to consult beteret-the cato populi and other recorda of the
times involved in his narratives.

We now come to the question of the date of the publication
cf the XII Caesare. Spartianus tells us² that Suetonius lost
his office at the same time as Septicius Clarus, ae.
122 an. Joannes Lydus³ states that the XII
Α Caesare were dedicated to Septicius Clarae, while
hewas praetorian prefect. The dedication and several other
