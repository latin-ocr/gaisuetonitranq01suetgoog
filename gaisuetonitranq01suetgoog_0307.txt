Pege 16. 1. rtonmaeum: ue omo os aa Poleam cr. nro m.
16. ὅ. regem se voluisse, eta: the acts and lives of the Ptolemies from
the time oi Philopator (222-205 n.c.), at least, had not been such as to
provoke admiration from so constructive a statesman as Augustus.

2. Aegyptum. . . redactam: Roman legions had been quartered in
Egypt in 55 rac. when Aulus Gabinius restored Ptolemy Auletes to his
throne. Yet Julius Caesar had hesitated to make-a provInce of it ior
fear that, under some hot-headed governor, it might furnish material ior
arevolt; cf. Jul. 35.1. The last princeos the Lagid house was now,
30 s.c., dead, however, and Augustus assumed the position of a Ptolemy
with reference to Egypt. Under his administration, then, it became the
private domain oi the princeps, with a government unlike that oi any
province. It was under a praefectus, or ‘viceroy'‚ who was the direct
servant oi the emperor and responsible to him alone, uniting in his
person the duties of both legatus and procurator of the ordinary imperial
provinces. This praefectus oi equestrian rank was supported by three
legions (aiter Augustus, by two) and performed all the ceremonia}
functione of the Egyptian kings. The revenues 'and taxes became the
private properton the emperor. Besides the praefectus there were at
least two officials of rank known as the turr'dr'cua Aegypti, for the ad-
ministering oi justice at Alexandria, and the idiologus (ἰδιολάγος, Strab.
XVII. 1. 12), for the management of certain financial matters, both ap
pointed by the emperor. Yet the principle of the dyarchy did not hold
in Egypt, however desirous Augustus might have been to have it appear
as subject, like the provinces, to the Roman pecple; cf. M. A. XXVII.
ὃ. 24, Aegyptum imperio popuii Romani educi. its status remained
essentially unchanged from its orgarnzation in 30 ac. to the time of
Diocletian. Cf. Dio LI. 17. 1 ff.; Tac, Har. I. 11,Ana.11.59. 4. See
Momms, Proc. of the Rom. Ernp. (Engl. Trans.) II. 252-329; Arnold,
Rom. Syri. cf Prov. Admr'n.² (11106), 22 ft, 128 ff.

3. habiliorem, etc: Egypt fed the Roman population during four
months oi every year, so that it may readily be understood why Augustus
should consider it necessary to keep so importante source of supply
under his direct control ; cf. Prin, Puney. 31. 2 : Percrebruerat actuarius
urbem uestram atsi opibus Aegypti uli sustenturr'quc acra posse. Aurelius
Victor (Epii. Ι. 6) gives an est-inlate of the annual imports in the time ol
Augustus: Huius [Augusti] tempore es Aegypto urbi curuo ducentur
centena milia frumeuti Inserebuaiur.
