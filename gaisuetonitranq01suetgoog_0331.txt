regularly and legally assume such offices. The age limite fixed for candi-
dates for the more important offiees by the 133 Vultu annalis of 180 nc.

minimum ages for the offices of quaestor, praetor and consul after Sulla's
tima were probably 31, 40 and 43 years, respectively. After 30 nc,
however, the ages were settled 101 the quaestorship at 25, the plebeian trib-
unale or 1113 aedileship at 27, the praetorship at 30, the consulship at 33.

legal age. But the senate might 1113113 special dispensatione in accordante
