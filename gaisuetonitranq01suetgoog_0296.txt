Lepidus. The father was proscribed with the consent oi Lepidus because
he had been one 01 the senators who voted to declare Lepidus a public
enemy for having joined Antony. Allowed to escape to Brutus, he later
went toMiletus, where he persteted in remaining even when pardoned by

19. quem ex Attica, eto. ι summoned from his province oi Africa on
July first, 36 n.c., Lepidus obeyed orders, but acted independently in
taking Lilybaeum and proceeding at his leisure to Messana. Here he

additional legions, according to Appian (B. G. V. 104. 430 11.), were the
remnant of four fresh legions from* Africa that had escaped shipwreck off
Lilybaeum. Velleius states that the iolly and audacity of Lepidus reached
such a pitch that he claimed the entire victory as his own and ordered
Octavian to withdraw from Sicily.
