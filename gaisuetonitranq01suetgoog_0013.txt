and patron of Suetonius, was praetorian prefect

fluence that our author was appointed to a secre-
taryship (ab musculis) in the household of Hadrian. While
absent in Britain, in 122 am, the emperor dismissed a large
number of household and public officials, and among them

Suetonius. This change was in some way connected with their

, relations to the empress Sabina⁵ It was. no doubt, during the

time of his official employment that Suetonius presented to ·
Hadrian a statuette of Augustus, as he himself tells us.⁶
After his retirement, our author seems to heve devoted years
of leisure to his learned compilatione. Such is his meager
biography, but his is not a case where we greatly
regret the lack of full details. It is not probable
that his life or his character was highly interesting.
