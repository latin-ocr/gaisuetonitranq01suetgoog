We can 3130 discover some traces 01 pride and interest in the

Consciensly or unconsciously, he appears to have shared the

Septicius Clarus, his second patron, was an intimate friend
01 Pliny, his first. Το him were dedicated the Letters 01
Pliny, 33 well 33 Suetonius’s XII Caesars. It is Protectedby
probahle that Suetonius was made secretary nb septicius
30130113 by Hadrian at about the same time that σιω
Septicius Clarus became 0333103133 0331301. The office was an
important one. The modest title recalls the time when the
early Gaesars were developmg their freedmen into ministers

the humble forms 01 household functione. We readily recall
the case 01 Narcissus, the powerful minister 01 Claudius, whose
title was simply nb epistulis. One 01 Hadrian’s administrative

occasionally, in such offices members 01 the eques-
trian order. It was 033 way 01 playing off this
order against the senatorial. Many 01 3133 imperial secretarios
were men distinguished 103 313313 learning or as writers. Some
01 them may have composed speeches 103 313313 masters but
this can hardly have been true in Suetonius's case, 103 Hadrian
prided himself on his own literary powers and his ideals 01
style were in complete contrast with Suetonius’s severe cor-
rectness. The scanty remains 01 Hadrian's writings are
marked by quaintness and “preciosity '²3 he indulged at the
same time in archaisms and neologisms. Yet the two men had
many interests ‘m common-prodigies, curiosities, antiquities,
wittinisms, grammar-which must have made their inter-
course a pleasure 10 both.
