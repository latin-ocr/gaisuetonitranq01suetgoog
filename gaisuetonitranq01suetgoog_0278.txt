tion with the dedication, 011 April 21, 01 the temple oi Venus Genetrix
which Caesar had vowed at Pharsalus in 48 ac. Octavius’s celebratior
occurred in May and lasted eleveu days. At this time the comet typiiy·
ing Caesar's apotheosis appeared on seven successive nights; 01. Jul. 88 ;

· 27. locum . . . demortui: the vacancy due to the death oi Helvius
Ginnawhen he was mistaken by the mob ior the assassin, L. Cornelius
Cinna, and literally torn to pieces. The storyis told in Jal. 85. oan-
dldatum 00 ostendit: announced himself as 0001111010. Octavian hall
put iorward a certain Flaminius 101 the office, but the people, in disregsrd ·
01 qualifications 01 age and rank, would have none other than the yormg
Octavian. Through his consular power 01 coercitio Antony stopped the
procoedings and the vacancy remained unfilled.

28. quanquam patricius: see note to page 49, line 23, and Introd.
Π. 16. m. necdum senator: to disregard the curata honorum, while
not illegal, was at least irregular. Octavian had not held the quaestor-
ship, which had qualified ior the senate since Sulla's time, and only sen-
ators were eligible ior the office oi tribune. His age might have been a
third objection. adversante. . . Antonlo: Octavian was opposed
by Antony in his claim 101 his patrimony, with regard to the lea curtata
necessary for his adoption, respecting the exercises in honor 01 Julius and
in his candidacy ior the office 01 tribanus saffectaa, 00 seen above.

For a time, at least, Antony thwartccl Octavian's adoption into a patri-
