authorities are numerous and abundent in these two cases,
whereas in all the 011101 100 11100 there are but five citatious 01
historiens by name.l Nearly all the authors cited are 000-
temporaries Ι01 Julius or Augustus.²

Suetonius was chiefly interestcd 10 the first two Caesare, not

· merely because of antiquarian 10010, but especially because

they were part 01 the Golden Age, the age· 01
chisirinterept Cicero and his successors who reached the highest
magen level of etteinment in Roman literature. Other

historiens enlarge the scale 01 their narratives as
they approach their own times. Just the reverse is true 01

Suetonius. Even with the loss 01 the first quaternio 01 leaves,
the Julius and Acqcctus 010 together es long as 1110 1001 00100
Lives, and the Augustas alone is longer than the last five.
Considering the scanty knowledge we have 01 Suetonius's
life and personality, and the meagerness 01 the 10010100 01
1000101 his works, it is hard to realize the ⁴wide
and persistent reputation enjoyed by them in 1110
Middlc Ages. His impersonal style and the con·
venient mechanica] arrangement 01 his material lent themselves
in 00 extraordinary degree to convenient citation, end 0100 10
the scanty remains 01 the literature that have 00100 down to us
there are countless traces 01 the use 01 Suetonius by later

attempting 10 enumerate all the grammarians, historiens, biog-
raphers and ecclesiastics who show their indebtedness to our
author, we may recall a few names in the list which arc famil·

Apuleius and Tertullian3 in the third and fourth, the Scrip
