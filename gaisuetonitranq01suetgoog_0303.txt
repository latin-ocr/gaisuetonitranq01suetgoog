Brundisii commoratus: Octavian went no further than Brundisium at
this time. Here he was enthusiastically received by senators and citizens
of every rank who had assembled to do him honor. He had just entered

15. brevi potitus est: into this sentence are crowded the events

Alexandria only after making an ineffectual appeal to the army (1110110101

and Cleopatra's betrayal 01 Ρο1ι10111111 10 Octavian, Antony was finally
deserted by the Egyptian 11001, 01 their queen's behest, and was thus de·
prived of all means 01 escape. At the false repert of the queen's death

him 01 011 hope 01 further resistance. His death was directly due, it
