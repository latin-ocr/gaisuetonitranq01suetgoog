'Emeric Bigot's library, which was purchased in 1706 for the
library which now contains the precisus manuscript. It is
the oldest and most reliable, by common agreement, of all the
manuscripts as yet discovered and examined. It lacks the
dedicatory epistle‚ which was known in the sixth century,
the title of the Lines and the first part of the Julius. The
first five words of our present text, Annum agan saalum

G. — Cadra Gudianus 268, of the eleventh century, in Wol-

from a codex that was mutilated towards the end Ihm
thought it was copied from G in 1456, while Ο. L. Smith was
inclined to think it was a copy of the immediate archetype of
G, which had become mutilated, in the meantime, towards the
end.¹

V.- (ledea Vaticanus 1904, of the eleventh or twelfth cen-
tury, in the Library of the Vatioan; the Vaticanus of Lipsius
and Torrentius, It has survived in a somewhat mutilated
condition, ending with deusta sua· re in Caligula 3. 3. Itis
marred by many careless errors of the copyist, as well as hy
