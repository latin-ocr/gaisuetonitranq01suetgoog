8. Provinciae venatores, etc: the provinces were diwded between
panceps and senate. Those requuing large military forces were governed
by Caesar's deputies with consular or praetorian rank, legati Augusti pro
praetore, appointed by him alone and holding office at his pleasure. The
rest were still to be governed by proconsuls selected under the supervision.
of the senate from the ex-praetors and err-consuls. In provinces of both
classes were procuratore appointed by the emperor and possessed of author-
ity over the finances independent of the legatus or proconsul. For a list
oi all the provinces, with dates of transfer, see Shuckburgh, Anesiates,

16. Latinitate vel civitate: Latinitas, or Ias Latii, in the early
empire designated a status between that of cives and that of pereprint.
Where a municipality possessed minas ias Latii, all its magistrates were

magistrates were possessed oi ciuitas.

17. staca et Sardinia: a visit to Africa with his uncle Julius in 45

however, to visit that province aiter Lepidus had been deprived oi it
