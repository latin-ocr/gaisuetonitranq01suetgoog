26. pererrem et libram emptos: the fictitious sale required thata
balance, libro, should be touched with a penny, aa, in the presence 01 a
praetor; 01. Gell. V. 19. 1-4. The adoption took place in 17 110, when
Gaius was in his third year and Lucius was just horn ; cf. Dio LIV. 18. 1 ;
Tac, Ann. 1. 3. 2. tenerosque adhuc, etc. : introduced them 1001010
administration while stili ostender years. Augustus himself thus gives
the iacis (M. A. XIV. 2. 46 ff.): Filios meos, quos iuvenes mihi eripuit
fortuna, Gaium et Lucium Caesares honoris mei cume senatus populus
que Romanus annum quinium et decimum aqentie consules desiccavit, ui
eum mapiatrutum inirent pori quinquennium. Et ec eo die quo deducti
suni in sorum, ui interessent conciliis publicio decreuit senatus. Equites
autem Romani uniuersi principem iuuentutis utrumque eorum parmis ei
hostis urpeutcis donatum appellaverunt. Gaius was born in 20 rac. aud
was consul designate in 5 nc. Lucius was born in 17 nc. and was con-
sul designate in 2 ac. Gaius was consul 01 110. ; Lucius was to have
been consul 01 41.0.,1)111 died 1112 11). The title 01 princeps iuuentutis
is analogous to princepe senatus. 11 was apparently new at this time.
Cf. Tac, Ann. 1.3. tf. ; Dio LV. 9. 23 Zon. X. 35.

28. circum provincias, etc. :see Introd. 11. §aa (1). Gaius was
in the East from 1 nc. until his death in 4111. 3 01. Tac, Anu. II. 4. 2,

³1. quod in diurnos commentarios reierretur: what michi he rc·
corded iu the hcuaehold diury. The cirstom 01 keeping such a record 01
events 01 the imperial household apparently dated 110111 the time 01
Augustus. The official commentarii 01 the emperors, such as are men-
tioned in Dcm. 20, commentarios et 0010 Tiberi Caesarianam keptby
slaves and ireedmen and were quite different from the diurni commentarii
hore mentioned. See Friedliinder, Rom. Life und Munners (Engl.
Transi), lv. 56. Mace (Eueni sur 1111110110ρὃ1.),1101101101,νί3010110117
attacks this explanation 01 diurni commentarii, which has been accepted
by Peter, Shuckburgh and others. Mace thinks the phrase refers to the
acin diurno, or ‘Daily Gazette⁷ ; see note to page 9, 111108. The passage
quoted (Dum. 20) would seem to indicate, however, that Suetonius used
acic and commentarii with different connotations; 01, also, Grum. 4, ὅ,
10,18; Jui. 56. tt, Tib. 61. 1.
