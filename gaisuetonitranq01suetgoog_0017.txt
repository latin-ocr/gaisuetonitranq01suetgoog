Viris Illustribaa This, however, is not mentioned in the
later letters of Pliny, which extend to 109 mn, nor does
Pliny allude to any published work of Suetonius in his 94th‘
letter to Trajan urging his claims to the ius triam liberorum.
We may therefore conclude that this work did not appear
before the date of the letter (111-113 mn). On the other
hand, it is perhaps a fair inference from St. Jerome's confusion
of the two Plinys in his De Viris Illustrihaa, which was based
in large measure upon Suetonius’s work of the same name,
that the younger Pliny was not included in the latter. The
probable reason for this fact, if it was a fact, is that Pliny
was still alive when it was published. Now Pliny died, as·
we suppose, in 113 mn.
Tacitus and Suetonius, so far as 'their extant works are oon·

rank. His powers and his tastes fitted him for a lower func
tion in literature. ’ His work was avaluable supplement, but
in no sense a rival to that of the great historian of the em-
perors. Though their books covered the same period, they
were quite independent of each other.

Suetonius must have been acquainted with men, among the
group of Pliny's friends, who could supply him with rich'
material from their personal recollections, and he
must have had access for years to many private
records of the senatorial party, as he had later,
whsn Hadrian's secretary, to the imperial archives. His asso
ciations with the senatorial party manifestly affected his
sympathies, which throughout the XII Caesars led him to
favor those emperors who, like Augustus, treated the Senate
with deferende and respect, and to take the most unfavorable
