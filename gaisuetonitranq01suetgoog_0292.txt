while Octavian, sailing witha second equadron from Tarentum, had
reached Rhegium and awaited Calvisius. On hearing of the latter's de-
feat, he attempted to reach him, but was attached and put to fiight, with
serious damage to his ships. The first shipwreck succeeded the defeat
of Calvisius, while he was entering the straits of Messana The second

united squadrons of Calvisius and Octavian suffered severe losses. Ap-

Sextus was cutting off the market supplies of Rome and'the populace
was in a state of insinrection. Negotiations were begua through Libo,
father-ln-law of Sextus and OctaUIan (who had married Scribonia the
preceding year), and the intercession of Mucia, mother of Sextus. Octa-
vian and Antony met Sextus at Misenum and, after failing to come to
terms at the first conferente, reached an agreement at a second meeting‚
according to which Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, with AcbaIa added, were
to be under the control of Sextus. Banquets and betrothals followed
