Chapter 4. Debut st the Bar. adventure with Pirstes

18. (Oa.) Cornelium Dolabellam consul aa. 81 with M. Tullius
Decula, afterward governed Macedonia and celebrated a triumph over the
Thraciam (Cic, tu Pisae. XIX). lle is tc be distinguished from the
propraetor oi Cilicia whose legate was Verres (Cic, ia Vera 1. 43 11.1. 15).
He was defended by C. Aurelius Cotta and Hortensius (Cia, Brut. 92. 317 ;
Valer. Max, Vlll. 9. 33 Plut, Caes. IV). There is disagreement as to
the date oi this prosecution. Plutarch agrees with Velleius Pateroulus
(11. 43) and Tacitus (Diui. 34). The statement ol Suetonius puts itin
ac. 77, when Caesar was 23. Tacitus says: utto et vicensimo (uetito).

19. triumphalem: unusual as a noun, without vtr‚· some MSS. add
oiruia; cf. page 63, line 31.- repetundarum postulavit: prosecuted
him under Sulla's law (as-79 aa). The quaestio de repetunda was one ol
the nine quaestiones, or permanent criminal courts established hy Sulla. a
It was a recognized custom for young nobles ιο make their 'debut in public
lile by prosecuting some prominent politician. Rome had no magistrates
charged with the duty of instituting proceedings iu such cases. The
genitive, instead of the ablativa with de, ispost-Augustan. ”

20. absolutoque: sc. Dolabella ,· the omission of the subjectos the
ablative absolute is rather harsh; Introd. ΙΙ. 5 9. ο. (5). et ad decli-
nandam. . . et ut, etc: note the coordination oi the different final
constructione ; Introd. Il. ξ 10. a.

21. Apollonio Moloni: the lather's name Molo is attached to the
son's, Apollonius, like a modern surname. Some would read Molonis.
This Apollonius Molo was also Cicero's teacher. Plutarch places this
period of study aiter Caesar’s capture by the pirates aud before his prose*-
cution oi Dolabella. We can hardly determine from this whether Caesar
actually spent auy time with Molo, or only intended ιο do su.

2³. dum . .’. tralclt: dara, ‘while ’, is normally used by Suetonius.

24. Pharmacussam insulam: a small island near the coast ol Asia
above Miletus3 not ιο he confounded with the two islets between Attica
and Salamis. a praedonibus: Plutarch's version ot the story (Caes.
11) is somewhat different. Valerius Maximus (VI. 9, 15) agrees with
this. In regard to the prevalence oi piracy in the Mediterranean atthis
period, read App, Mithr. XCII. sqq. The subjugation ol these pirates was
one of Pompey’s brilliant achievements.

25. non sine: ci. aaa stae reamare, page 2, line t, aud note.

26. cum uno. . . duobus: chiastic order.

2⁷. servosque ceteros: uttd his other attendants, who were slaves
