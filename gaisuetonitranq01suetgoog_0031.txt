alcmon ΛΝΒ STYLE OF staremus

Souronros may be said to possess a distinct style of his own

Naturally, 116 exhibite certain characteristica observable in
¹ other writers-¹ of the Silver Age: he can scarcely be expected
to avoid the poetic coloring, the use oi words and phrases in
altered meanings, even the adoption oi novel expressions and
unusual constructione when compared with the usage of wri-
ters of the classyical period. Yet his staid and sober intellect
has resisted, toan extraordinary degree, the tendency to rhe-
torical ornamentation so characteristic of Pliny and other wri-
’ ters of his time. Far more concernedis he witha condensed
presentation of the facts of ancient history, of ancient life and
institutione. His Lives of the Caesare is a marvel of terso,

. compaot‚ vigorous narrative, comprising within briei compass

a remarkable amount of interesting and valuable information.
Yet his brevity is not the epigrammatic terseness of a Tacitus.
Suetonius commands attention rather by his simple, clear,
. straightforward delineation, but rarely displaying qualities of
eloquence and genuine dramatic power. Even his longest
periods are seldom tinged with obscurity of expression.
More often, perhaps, itis his very conciseness of utterance‚
with undue importance attaching toa single word or phrase,
ᾗ that causes his reader to pause and refleot upon the full signifi-
canoe of a statement. But Suetonius himself never tarries for
calm judgment and accurate weighing oi the evidence 116 pre-
661116. Although he is not lavish of words, he has nevertheless
composed passages of animated, concise narrative that are en·

tirely free from a tenderrcy to abruptness or obscurity.
