litzi, commanding an extensive view alike of the outer sea near Paxa,
the inner Ambraciot gulf and the intervening waters; ef. Dio L. 12. 7 f.
His camp was on the lower ground, where Nicopolis later was built.
Dio states (LI. l. 3) that a foundation of stenes was laid on the spot
where Octavian's tent had been and that a shrine oi Apollo was located
there, open.to the sky and adorned with beaks of captured ships.
lucraturus: in compound passive tenses Suetonius often uses the tenses
of esse formed on the perfect stem in preference to those formed on the
present stem3 cf. page 22, line 9, perscriptam saisset; page 65, ilne 9,
fuerat occisas. Livy’s⁸fondness for the same usage may be compared.

10. navalibus spolils: the beaks of the captured ships, as seen from
Dio LI. 1. 3. Other trophies of the naval battle consisting of captured
ships of various sizes, from a trireme to a vessel of ten banks of oars,
were apparently set up as an offering to Apollo Actiacus in connection
with the enlargement of the ancient temple; cf. Dio LI. 1. 2 ; Strab.
VII. 7. 6. The trophies are mentioned in an epigram of the first cen-
tury, nn. ; cf. Antbol. Pol. VI. 236. Neptuno ac Marti: such a
double dedication might naturally follow a naval victory. No disaster
resembling those in the Sicilian war had occurred to retard the move-
ments at Actium3 cf. Any. 16. Shuckburgh suggests, in his note to this
passage, that the dedication to Neptune was an amende bonorable for
the impious etiam incito Neptuno victorianae adeptunrm of Aac. 16. 2;
but sec note to page 54, line 3. Our author alone mentions the double
dedication. Dio states (LI. 1. al.) that the shrine was in honor of
Apollo.

chapter 19. Plots end conspiracies

11. Tumultus. . . initia: insurrectione ond incipient renotatione.
Cicero (Phil. VIII. 1. 2-4), in distinguishing between bellam and turnul-
tus, concludes that while a bellam may exist without a turnultus, the
reverse of this is impossible. Strictly speaking, however, bellum was
not declared except against those persons, whether citizens or not, who
had been formally named as hostes by the government. coniurationes:
conspiracies against the life of Augustus.

luerat ; Ner. 27. 1, incalescentibus vitiis. Convalescere occurs ln a similar

meaning on page 71, line 16.
