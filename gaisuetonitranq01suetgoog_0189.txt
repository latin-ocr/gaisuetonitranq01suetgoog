known quotation from bis writings. Marcus Bibulus: caesar’s col·
league in the curule aedileship. The reference may perhaps be to the
later edicta oi his consulship, 59 s.c., when he was agam Caesar’s ool-
league, when cicere in his letters ridiculed the “Archilochian edicte oi
Bibulus ’² (ad Aa. Il. 19, 20, 21).

known orator, the father ol caesar's elever and unscrupulous partisan.

different. Note the tense oi aaut ; Introd. 11. § 7. a.

5. Ambranos: even if thisIs assumed ao the correct reading, the
identification is quite uncertain. Tbey may possibly be the remnants ei
predatory Gauls, destroyed, for the most part, by Marius (Lis, Epis.
LXVIII; Eutrop, V. 13 Oros, V. 6; Plut, Mor. XVIII and XIX).
