but there is a description of them in the florid
verses of Statius1addressed to Flavius Abascantos, secretary
of Domitian. No doubt Suetonius's relations with the emperor
were cordial. Hadrian was entirely simple in his manners

He cites more letters of Augustus than all other writers
combined. There were many letters of this emperor which
had been published. Those which Suetonius cites
seem rather to be such as would not probably have
been published, for various reasons which are
readily suggested by their contenta. And he cites them so
careiully, emphasizing the anthenticity of his sources, that it
seems unlikely he was merely repeating what was already
known to the world. One point is significant: he tells us
which letters were in Augustus's own handwriting. His giv-
ing the key to the ciphers of Julius and of Augustus may also
be significant. The dates and other details of the wills of
Julius, Augustus and Tiberius are given with extraordinary
