2. 2 a CensorIal power, it will bs recalled, was inherent in the consular
office before the censorship existed as a distinct office. Augustus, appar-
ently, never assumed either general or permanent consular power, but
used the powers oi consul only in so iar as he exercised censorlal power.
The extraordinary powers granted hIm in and through the tribunicia
potestas were all-sufficIent ior his purpose. His cara moram is men·
tioned by Horace (Od. IV. 15. eff. ς ap. 11. 1. 2) and Ovid (Met. XV.
832 ff.; Trist. Π. 233 ft). See Momms, Res Gest. 36 ff.; Ram.

pepuli. See Mommsen, Rlim. Staatsr. 1113311. While possessed tem-
porarily 01 cermeria potestas, therefore, Augustus avoided the obnoxious
title of censor. The last lustrum before that oi 28 nc. was held in 69
