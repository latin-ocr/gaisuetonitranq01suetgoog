27. Octavia maiore: not mentioned elsewhere. Plutarch's state- ·

ment (Ant. XXXI) implying.,that there was only one Octavia, daughter
oi Ancharia and hali sister of Augustus, is not consistent with Dio's
assertion (LIV. 35. 4) that at her death the body oi an Octavia, sister oi
Augustus, was placed in the heroam Iuliam, which would indicate con-
nection with the 9010Ιο110. octavia minore: own sister oi Augustus ;
married C. Marcellus (consul 0156 ac.) 11 the year 54 ac. and later, in
41 0140 n.c.‚ was married to Mark Antony : cf. Jal. 27. 1 ; Dio XLVIII.
31. 3; Plut.‚ Ant. XXXI. Her son by Marcellus was the Marcellus
mentioned in Aac. 63. 1 and 66. 3 ; 01. Tib. 6. 4, 1o. 1. Julius Caesar was
unsuccessiul 11 his attempta to effect a match between her and Pompcy.
Her marriage to Antony wasa political one and more than once she was the
means of reconciling husband and brother. Her devotion to Antony de-
spite his infidelity is indicative oi her noble character. She was divoroed
from 1110111132 ac. and died in 11 aa, 101119 ac. as stated by
8001011100 (Aac. 61.. 2). Ηο1 son, Marcellus, had died 1123 ac. In 33
’ ao. Augustus had built a 10111001 Octauiae surrounded by other build-
ings. For the whole question oi an elder and a younger Octavia see
