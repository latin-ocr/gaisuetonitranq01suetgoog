poison of reptiles from wounds without harm to themselves and are even

LVI> their power as snake charmers. quod perisse, etc: Cleopatra
died in her fortieth year after a reign of twenty-two years, oi which more
than fourteen were in joint rule with Antony. Dio and Plutarch cast
doubt upon the manner of her mysterious death and mention other
means that were said to have been employed. Velleius and Florus
follow the traditional account. Plutarch nates, however, that an effigy
of Cleopatra was borne in Octavian's triumphal procession with an asp
clinging to her arm; thus indicating Octavian's belief, at least, in the
commonly accepted version. The poets have preserved the common
tradition, as witness Horace (Οά. Ι. 37. 20 n),

Corpore combiberet venenum,
